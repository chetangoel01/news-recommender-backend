# Scripts Directory

This directory was previously used for database setup and utility scripts, but those files have been removed as they are not needed for the core application functionality.

## ðŸ“„ Current Status

**No scripts currently present** - All database modification scripts have been removed since:
- The application uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- Database tables are created automatically by the application
- Migration and setup scripts are not needed for core functionality
